# Towards a Foundation Model for Text-guided Brain Medical Image Synthesis



Welcome! This is the official implementation of BrainSyn, a generative foundation model that can synthesize high-quality brain images covering a wide spectrum of imaging modalities, guided by textual imaging parameters.
BrainSyn demonstrates unprecedented flexibility in performing both inter-modality synthesis (e.g., MRI-to-PET, CT-to-PET, and CT-to-MRI) and fine-grained intra-modality synthesis (e.g., 3T-to-7T MRI, FDG-PET-to-AV45-PET, and multi-cohort harmonization).
